    <h1>About Me (in more detail)</h1>
    <p>Hi. My name is foxxer/foxxertech and I am from Australia. I am intrested in tech from the 2000's, like Windows 7 and the Thinkpad. My life started in NSW where I have been
        living my entire life. My first computer was built on the 22nd of July, 2021. Me and my dad built it together for my birthday. It contained 16GB of DDR4 Ram, a GTX 1060
        with 6GB of VRAM, a AMD Ryzen 5 3600, and a 500GB HDD with Windows 10 1809. In 2022, I wanted to learn programming. I started with Visual Basic, then moved to HTML,
        and now I am learning Python. I would like to mention <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BroCodez" target="_blank"> Bro Code</a>. This person gave me all my HTML and
        python knowledge. In 2022, I also upgraded my PC to a 1TB SSD, New RAM, AMD Ryzen 5500 and a new Motherboard. This was around the time my brother who was 15 at the time, got a new laptop
        and I got the old one. Around this time, I had gotten into Homelabbing, and I used that laptop as a NAS. I used Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, and SAMBA as the file sharing protocol.
        Sadly, in early 2023, the laptop's battery started to swell, and I had to stop using it. Before it was chucked, I salvaged the 1TB HDD and used it for extra storage in my PC.
        In October 2023, my pop was diagnosed with Stage 2 lung cancer. By this time, it was already too late. On christmas 2023, I got a new GPU, and its the same one I use to this day! Its the AMD RX 6600 with 8GB of VRAM. I also got a new monitor, the Philips 242S, which is a 1080p
        75Hz monitor. This was one of the last days I saw my pop. On June 10th, 2024 at 1:27 AM, I was awoken by my mother alerting me that my pop had passed away,
        without pain in sleep. He was 68 years old. Skipping over to christmas 2024, when I got my first VR headset, the Meta Quest 3S. In Febuary, 2025 I met Sopv
        on a Minecraft server. Sopv then invited me to the Republic Of Batarong Discord server. I also was invited to a groupchat with Sopv, and a few others.
        I am now good friends with the people in that groupchat now, and we still all chat to this day. On my birthday in 2025, I recived
        100$, a Raspberry Pi 5 4GB model, and a model Boeing 727. On the twelth of July, 2025, I bought a prebuilt PC from WeBuy AU. It was a HP Prodesk 600 G3 SFF.
        It had a 7th gen i5, 8GB of DDR4 ram (that i upgraded to 16gb), and a 256GB SSD. I installed a 4TB hard drive that I had laying around, and installed Ubuntu 24.04 LTS
        on the computer to use it as a NAS, Minecraft server, Samba Share and plex server. That same day I installed apache 2 to my Raspberry Pi 5, and this webpage will soon
        be migrated there.
        Thanks for reading my life story so far. tO bE cOnTiNuEd...
